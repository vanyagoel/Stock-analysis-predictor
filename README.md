# S&P 500 Stock Price Predictor

My target audience for this dataset would be :- Investors, Competitors, Stock brokers and financial advisors. I have analyzed the growth and performance of top 5 and worst 5 performing companies. I have also analysed Bank of America's stock performance from Feb 2013 to Feb 2018 on the basis of below mentioned points:

Finding any trend, pattern or seasonality in its stock including any anomaly that may have occurred. I have tried exploring both the internal (C-level executives hiring/firing etc.) and external factors (market factors like recession, governmental regulations etc.) that led to the impact on the stock performance. This would help the target audience to check how much potential a stock has and whether that stock is worth investing on.

Comparing Bank of America's stock performance with that of Wells Fargo and exploring the same internal/external factors. This helps the companies and their competitiors to design their future strategies and time their product/service reveal. Moreover, it helps investors in deciding whether they should withdraw their shares from one company and invest in the other one instead.

Apart from that, I have applied a time series forecasting model i.e Facebook Prophet to predict the future performance of both the banks stocks on the basis of historical performance and other factors. This helps the financial advisors who can advise their customers on where they should invest their money.
